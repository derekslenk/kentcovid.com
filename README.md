## About
This sites uses data generated by Huginn website agents (working on providing code) to which the data is stored in a S3 public bucket: http://micovid-data.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/

## Dependencies
- PHP >= 7.0 (untested on PHP 8)
- PHP Composer v1.10.1 is what I am using 
- A webserver (I am using NGINX) with the appropriate PHP extensions (I am using php-fpm)

## Edit the source
1. Clone the repo
2. In the cloned directory, run `composer install`
3. Run crawl.php to pull the data from the S3 bucket and generate data.json: `php crawl.php`
3. Point your webserver at the directory.
4. Enjoy your content
